        <h3>Metamorph - scripted refactoring and analysis</h3>
	
	<p>
	  <a href="https://gitgub.com/grahambrooks/metamorph">Metamorph</a>
	  came into being after watching a Google presentation on
	  using Clang Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Hadoop map
	  reduce to refactor large (10M lines) C++
	  codebases. Metamorph currently targets Java to allow library
	  and framework publishers to include a scripted set of code
	  level changes with their work. These code migrations operate
	  on the client code to bring that code into line with the
	  updates included in a release.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Lets take the example of a jar dependency where a project B
	  uses a jar A.jar from another organisation (which may or may
	  not be open source). The producer of A can either make
	  changes which break B or work through a deprecation cycle
	  encouraging client code to be updated over an extended
	  release cycle.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Metamorph offers a 3rd option where a migration file
	  A.migration is published with the new version. Metamorph
	  then reads that migration and examines project B's source
	  code and makes the changes outlined in the
	  migration. Project B can then be compiled and tested against
	  the new version of A.
