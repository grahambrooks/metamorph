# metamorph - Source Code Morphing

A language aware automation tool for analysing and updating source
code.

# Overview

IDEs provide excellent feature for manipulating source code
interactively. Meta-morph's goal is to provide similar functionality
but driven by scripts.

Initially metamorph will manipulate Java source to help update client
code to accommodate updated libraries and frameworks.
